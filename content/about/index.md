Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Bio-Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [BIT Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/). Since then, I started developing Web and ML projects, and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

Today, I'm currently working as a scrum developer responsible for several microservices code development and testing in Amdocs Technology Billing and RTB project.

I have also been awarded as Winner in Design Thinking Hackathon and Runners-Up in [Project ICE Fair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1laynNsd9hIqxL-imT8dkAWqq7ZO4hj1a/view?usp=sharing) by Amdocs.

Here is a list of the technologies that I work with in Amdocs!
